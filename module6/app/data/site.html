<p>Prairie Pothole (PRPO) is an aquatic NEON field site located about 160 km (100 mi.) northeast of Bismarck, North Dakota. This site's watershed is 1.4 km2 (346 acres) and is managed by the U.S Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the larger Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge. PRPO sits among the restored prairie and is part of a matrix of small lakes, ponds, and ephemeral prairie potholes in the area. The region is characterized by an immense number of prairie potholes, which are depressional wetlands that are primarily freshwater marshes. The site is part of NEON's Northern Plains Domain (D09). The Domain has one other aquatic field site and three terrestrial field sites.  PRPO is colocated with The Northern Plains- Woodworth (WOOD) terrestrial site. [1] [2]</p>
