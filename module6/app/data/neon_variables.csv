Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen,Nitrogen,DIN,milligramsPerLiter,Nitrogen is available for phytoplankton uptake in the form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. It is comprised of nitrate plus nitrite and ammonium. These forms of nitrogen are readily available for uptake by phytoplankton and often control the formation of algal blooms.,https://acwi.gov/monitoring/network/nutrients.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Chlorophyll-a,chla,microgramsPerLiter,Chlorophyll-a is measured in lakes to determine how much algae is in the lake. Algae is important in lakes because it adds oxygen to the water as a by-product of photosynthesis but if there is too much algae in a lake it can produce a foul odor and be unpleasant for swimming. Chlorophyll-a concentration can tell you a lot about the lake's water quality and trophic state.,"https://www.rmbel.info/primer/chlorophyll-a/#:~:text=Chlorophyll%2Da%20is%20the%20pigment%20that%20makes%20plants%20and%20algae%20green.&text=Chlorophyll%2Da%20is%20tested%20in,a%20by%2Dproduct%20of%20photosynthesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissolved Oxygen,Dissolved Oxygen,dissolvedOxygen,milligramsPerLiter,"Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is the amount of oxygen dissolved in lake water. Oxygen is necessary for all living organisms to survive except for some bacteria. Living organisms breathe in oxygen that is dissolved in the water. The amount of oxygen lake water can hold is directly related to temperature. The colder the water, the more dissolved oxygen it can hold.",https://www.rmbel.info/primer/dissolved-oxygen/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
