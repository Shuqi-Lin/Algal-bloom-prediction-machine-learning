q1,What is meant by the term 'uncertainty' in the context of ecological forecasting?,Introduction:
q2,"How do you think knowing the uncertainty in a forecast helps natural resource managers? For example, if a drinking water manager received a toxic algal bloom forecast with high vs. low uncertainty in a bloom prediction, how might that affect their decision-making?",Introduction:
