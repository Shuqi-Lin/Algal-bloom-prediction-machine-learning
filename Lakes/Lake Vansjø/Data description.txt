The dataset is from 1994-2015

There are some modelled variables (temperature profiles and some inflow discharge and water temperature).
The chemistry data contains a few NaNs as well.

Lake Vansjø is a large lake with two main basins (Storefjorden – 24km2 and Vanemfjorden – 12 km2).
The attached dataset is for Vanemfjorden (see attached hypsography for depths). 
So in the discharge data, I included measured inflow at Kure (upstream of Storefjorden, subcatchment of 304 km2), 
and other modelled inflow and water temperature: inflow into Storefjorden, 
outflow from Storefjorden into Vanemfjorden (connection between the two basins) and an additional inflow into Vanemfjorden 
(vanem subcatchment).
